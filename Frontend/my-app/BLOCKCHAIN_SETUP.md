# Blockchain Voting Integration Setup

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
# Install Hardhat
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# Initialize Hardhat project
npx hardhat init

# Deploy contract to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### 2. Update Contract Address
In `src/services/blockchainService.js`, update the contract address:
```javascript
this.contractAddress = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
```

### 3. Configure Network
Make sure MetaMask is connected to the correct network (Sepolia testnet recommended for testing).

### 4. Test the Integration
1. Connect MetaMask wallet
2. Navigate to any election
3. Click "Vote" button
4. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
5. Vote is recorded on blockchain!

- `hasVoted(electionId, voter)` - Check if voter has voted
- `getVoteCount(electionId, candidateId)` - Get candidate vote count
- `VoteCast` event - Emitted when vote is cast

## 🛡️ Security Features

- One vote per address per election
